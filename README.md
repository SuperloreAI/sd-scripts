# sd-scripts

To work correctly in dev, you should add sd_webui as the interpreter in pycharm. I.e. 

1. Open the PyCharm settings by going to File > Settings (or using the keyboard shortcut Ctrl + Alt + S on Windows or Linux, or Cmd + , on Mac).
2. Go to the "Project: [project name]" section and select "Project Interpreter".
3. Click the gear icon on the right side of the "Project Interpreter" field and select "Show All...".
4. In the "Interpreter Paths" dialog, click the "Show paths for the selected interpreter" button.
5. Click the "+" icon to add a new path.
6. Enter the full path to other_repo/scripts/ and click "OK".
7. Close all the settings dialogs by clicking "OK" or "Apply".
